one of the most extensively mapped conflicts in recent history. This report aims to provide a
comprehensive analysis of the battles that have taken place in Syria, focusing on various aspects
such as the nature of data, main actors involved, fatalities, the involvement of Turkey over the
years and news transparency by investigating the news sources reporting on the Syrian battles.

groups, the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the distribution of public
resources, and most importantly, territorial control.
